# Beads for Obsidian

A tiny, **desktop-only** Obsidian plugin that renders a **live, clickable pane** for the
[Beads (`bd`)](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) issue tracker — and does *real*
integration: click any issue to **edit it in a tab**, as YAML frontmatter + a markdown
body, and save straight back to `bd`.

No Obsidian + Beads plugin existed before this one — it fills a genuine gap for anyone
who tracks work in `bd` and lives in Obsidian.

## Features

- 🗂️ **Ready-first, tabbed pane** — a native `ItemView` with **Ready · In progress ·
  Blocked · Closed** tabs (each with a live count), so you open straight to *what you
  can do right now*. Only the active tab hits `bd`, and each paginates with **Load
  more**, so the pane opens fast even with thousands of closed issues. Blocked rows show
  a `⛓ n` hint.
- ✏️ **Edit in a tab** — click a row and the bead opens like a note (not a popup): a
  **YAML frontmatter** block for the fields (title, type, priority, status — set it to
  `closed` to close, or back to `open` to reopen) and a **markdown body** for the
  description. Save (or ⌘/Ctrl-S) writes only the changed fields via `bd update`; broken
  frontmatter is reported, never silently dropped. **Blocked by** / **Blocks**
  dependencies and the **comment thread** (rendered markdown) show below.
- ⚡ **Quick capture** — *Beads: Capture a bead* (or the `+` in the pane) opens a box:
  type a title and press Enter for the fast path, or set type / priority / description
  first (`bd create`).
- 🤖 **Work the bead** — hand one bead to a CLI coding agent. Pick a harness you've
  defined (Claude Code, Codex, anything with a command line), and the plugin builds a
  prompt from the bead's fields *and its dependency context* and shows you the exact
  command. **Nothing runs from Obsidian**: you copy the command, open a terminal (one
  button does that at the project root), paste, and press Enter yourself. See
  [Security](#security).
- 📄 **Live `beads` code blocks** — embed a query in any note (Dataview-style) and get
  the same clickable rows inline. See [Embedding queries](#embedding-queries-in-notes).
- 🔢 **Status-bar count** — an ambient `● N ready` even when the pane is closed.
- 🔄 **Auto-refresh** — on a configurable interval *and* whenever the `.beads`
  directory changes on disk (so external `bd` edits show up).
- ⚙️ **Near-zero setup** — if your vault folder itself contains a `.beads/`, the
  project root auto-fills on first load.

## Requirements

- **Obsidian desktop** — the plugin shells out to a local binary via Node's
  `child_process`, which is unavailable on mobile. `isDesktopOnly` is set.
- **The `bd` CLI** — install [Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) and make
  sure `bd` is on your `PATH` (or set an explicit path in settings).

## Installation

### Community plugins (once accepted)

Settings → Community plugins → Browse → search **"Beads"** → Install → Enable.

### Manual

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest
   [release](https://github.com/Rome-1/obsidian-beads/releases).
2. Copy them into `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/beads-pane/`.
3. Reload Obsidian and enable **Beads** under Community plugins.

## Usage

1. Open **Settings → Beads** and set **Project root** to a directory that contains a
   `.beads/` database (auto-filled if your vault folder has one). Click **Test
   connection** to confirm `bd` is reachable.
2. Open the pane: click the **list-checks** ribbon icon, or run **"Beads: Open Beads
   pane"** from the command palette. Switch tabs (Ready / In progress / Blocked /
   Closed) and use **Load more** to page through long lists.
3. Click a row to open the bead in an editor tab. Edit the **YAML frontmatter** (title,
   type, priority, **status** — set it to `closed` to close, or back to `open` to
   reopen) and the **markdown body** (the description), then **Save** (or ⌘/Ctrl-S).
   Dependencies and the comment thread show below.
4. Capture new work anytime with **"Beads: Capture a bead"** (bind it to a hotkey) or
   the `+` in the pane header.

## Embedding queries in notes

Put a fenced `beads` code block in any note to render a live, clickable list right
where you're thinking. One directive per line:

````markdown
```beads
ready
```
````

````markdown
```beads
query: status=open AND priority<=1
limit: 10
```
````

Accepted directives:

| Directive | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ready` | Unblocked, actionable issues (`bd ready`). |
| `blocked` | Issues waiting on dependencies (`bd blocked`). |
| `list` | All open issues (`bd list`). |
| `query: <expr>` | A [bd query](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) expression, e.g. `status=open AND priority<=1`. |
| `limit: <n>` | Max rows (clamped to 50). |

Embeds re-run when the note renders (and after you close an issue from one) — never on
a timer — and share a global read cache, so many blocks won't hammer `bd`.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project root | *(empty)* | Absolute path to the directory containing `.beads/`. |
| `bd` binary path | `bd` | Path to the `bd` executable. If not found, use the full path from `which bd` (see Troubleshooting). |
| Auto-refresh interval | `30` | Seconds between refreshes (`0` disables). |
| Harnesses | Claude Code, Codex CLI *(examples)* | Named CLI coding agents. Each has a command template using `{prompt}` (the generated prompt, shell-quoted) and `{model}`. The shipped two are editable examples, not a maintained list of vendor flags — fix them to match the CLI you actually have. |
| Prompt template | *(built in)* | The generated prompt. Placeholders: `{id}` `{title}` `{description}` `{status}` `{priority}` `{type}` `{labels}` `{assignee}` `{project}` `{blockers}` `{dependents}`. Clear the box to restore the default. |
| Terminal launch command | `open -a Terminal {dir}` (macOS) | argv for opening your terminal at the project root. Split on spaces and run **without a shell**; `{dir}` is substituted per-token, so a path with spaces stays one argument. |

## Troubleshooting

- **"bd binary not found" / the pane is empty and *Test connection* fails.** GUI-launched
  apps often don't inherit your shell `PATH`, so the default `bd` can't be resolved. Run
  `which bd` in a terminal and paste the full path into **Settings → Beads → bd binary
  path**.
- **"No bd database here."** The project root must be a directory that contains a
  `.beads/` folder. Point it at your `bd` project (not necessarily your vault).
- **`bd` won't close a blocked issue.** It won't close an issue that still has open
  blockers; the error is shown as a notice. Close its blockers first (the editor tab
  lists them under **Blocked by** — click one to jump to it).
- **The pane didn't update after a CLI change.** It refreshes on an interval and when
  `.beads/` changes on disk; hit the refresh icon to force it.

## Security

- The plugin runs the `bd` binary you configure, in the project root you configure —
  the same trust model as the [Shell commands
  plugin](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands). Point it only at a `bd`
  you trust.
- Commands are invoked with `execFile` and an **argument array** — never a shell
  string — so issue IDs and other values can't inject shell metacharacters.
- Issue titles and descriptions render as plain text (never HTML) in the pane, so a bead
  authored elsewhere and synced in can't inject markup. Comment threads in the editor
  render through Obsidian's own `MarkdownRenderer` — the same sanitized path as any note.
  Data-controlled values are also passed after a `--` sentinel (or as `--flag=value`) so
  they can't be reparsed as `bd` flags.
- **Work the bead never runs your coding agent.** It builds the command, shows it
  verbatim, and copies it to the clipboard; you paste it and press Enter. There is no
  auto-run path. The generated prompt is POSIX single-quoted, so a bead description
  containing `; rm -rf ~` pastes as inert text inside one argument.
- The one process **Work the bead** can start is your terminal emulator, from an explicit
  button click, via `execFile` with an argv array (no shell) — same rule as `bd`.
- The plugin runs `bd` against whatever `.beads/` your project root points at (including
  an auto-detected vault-local one). It never executes anything *from* the dataset — but
  that means you trust `bd`'s own parsing of that database, as with any `bd` invocation.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # esbuild watch → main.js
npm run build   # typecheck + production bundle
```

To test against a real vault, symlink or copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and
`styles.css` into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/beads-pane/`.

## Prior art (inspiration)

- **[Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands)**
  — the canonical desktop-only `child_process` pattern.
- **Beads** — `bd --help`, `bd list --json`, `bd show --json`, `bd close`.
- High-star pane/view plugins (Kanban, Tasks, Dataview) for `ItemView` and
  workspace-leaf conventions.
